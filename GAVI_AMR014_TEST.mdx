## Titles Section 1.1: HSIS flagship interventions
### Subtitles A.	Extending reach to under-immunized, zero dose children & missed communities
**Scope & Objective** 
>This intervention targets zero-dose and under-immunised children by embedding tailored catch-up vaccination strategies into routine immunisation services. It focuses on the most marginalised communities — those facing socioeconomic, geographic, and gender-related barriers — to reduce immunisation gaps and prevent disease outbreaks. The primary objective is to reduce the number of zero-dose children in Gavi-supported countries by 25% from 2019 levels by 2025 and by 50% by 2030, aligned with Gavi 5.0 and IA2030 strategic goals.

**Eligibility**

<All Gavi-supported countries are eligible to implement this intervention as part of Health System Strengthening (HSS) grant.>
At least 10% of the funding must be channeled through Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).
**Proposed Operational Approach, Strategies & Activities**
The intervention is structured around Gavi’s IRMMA framework (Identify, Reach, Monitor and Measure, Advocate).
•	Identify: Use zero-dose analysis cards and disaggregated data to locate high-burden areas and understand barriers.
•	Reach: Tailor strategies, such as Periodic Intensification of Routine Immunisation (PIRI), outreach/mobile clinics, and integration with maternal and child health services. Prioritise underserved groups like migrants, urban slum dwellers, and remote communities.
•	Monitor & Measure: Conduct real-time monitoring, EPI reviews, and community feedback loops to assess effectiveness.
•	Advocate: Mobilise political commitment and financing through inclusive planning involving CSOs and local leaders.

Key activities may include:
•	Implementing integrated catch-up vaccination during all routine immunisation contacts.
•	Screening and referral systems during school enrolments.
•	Health worker training on gender-sensitive service delivery.
•	Integration with other PHC and UHC services (e.g., nutrition, adolescent health and antenatal care).
Common Challenges, Proposed Solutions & Best Practices
•	Challenge: Geographic and infrastructure limitations in remote areas.
Solution: Deploy mobile units, use geospatial mapping tools, and apply differentiated delivery models.
•	Challenge: Gender norms restricting caregiver access.
Solution: Provide flexible hours, involve female health workers, and run targeted communication campaigns.
•	Challenge: Low trust or misinformation.
Solution: Engage local leaders, CSOs, and peer educators in community engagement and demand generation.
Best Practices:
•	Use of integrated school-based vaccination checks.
•	Leveraging health days for broader community catch-up efforts.
•	Real-time campaign monitoring using digital platforms.
Vision of Success: Projected Outputs & Outcome
By 2025, countries implementing this intervention will:
•	Achieve a 25% reduction in zero-dose children from 2019 levels.
•	Strengthen routine immunisation systems through integrated service delivery.
•	Demonstrate improved equity in immunisation access.
•	Establish sustainable, gender-sensitive delivery models adaptable to future public health needs.
